					<h3>Ergonomics and aesthetics</h3>
					<p>During the whole course of the development of the application, we have tried to keep it as simple as possible, with the purpose of <strong>ergonomics and aesthetics</strong>. We would like the user to immediately identify the actions that are proposed without having to think. The results are that we have used simple but representative logos. This is the same with the colours which are <strong>contrasting but harmonious.</strong></p>
					<p>We thus propose two pages. The first page, the entry page, permits viewing the vocal synthesizer. The second page, available via a button, shows the vocal recognition. The placement of the buttons of each page is thought of for <strong>a tactical usage</strong>, for example, after the keyboard for the vocal synthesizing has appeared, the button remains visible. This is the same for the button of the vocal recognition which is the easiest accessible.</p>
					<h3>Essentially</h3>
					<p>Similarly, we wished not to hand to many settings to the user. Just the <strong>most important settings</strong>, those of the size of the text for the readability, or the speed/tone of the voice are changeable. The access to the documentation is also simplified due to a direct shortcut.</p>
