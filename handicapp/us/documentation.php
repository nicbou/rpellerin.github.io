<h3 id="sv">Voice synthesis</h3>
<a title="Enlarge" href="../res/images/documentation/premiere.png"><img style="width: 50%; float: left;" src="../res/images/documentation/premiere.png" alt="PNG" /></a>
<p>This is the first page you see when you launch the application. It is made out of two main areas that correspond to the voice synthesis and the speech recognition. If the vocal synthesizer is not activated on your device, a dialogue box will appear and invite you to turn it on, because without it, the synthesizer doesnâ€™t work.</p>
<p>The field at the top allows you to caption your text before you vocally synthetize it. The synthesizer starts after you press the "Listen" button. For pausing, press the same button once more. The synthesizer is in the language that your device is in.</p>
<h4 id="svaa">Other actions</h4>
<p>The big button that contains a microphone, allows you to launch the speech recognition (see below). Finally, the parameters of the application are accessible via the icon at the top right of the application.</p>
<h3 id="rv">Speech recognition</h3>
<a title="Enlarge" href="../res/images/documentation/deuxieme2.png"><img style="width: 23%; float:right;" src="../res/images/documentation/deuxieme2.png" alt="PNG" /></a><a title="Enlarge" href="../res/images/documentation/deuxieme1.png"><img style="width: 23%; float:right;" src="../res/images/documentation/deuxieme1.png" alt="PNG" /></a>
<p>After launching the speech recognition from the home page of the application, this is what appears (in order of apparition, if a text has been recognized). The first photo displays the phase "speech recognition". During this phase, you are asked to speak. After you have finished speaking, your device takes a few seconds to analyse what you have said and then shows it on the screen. You then have the possibility to directly modify the text, if any mistakes have slipped through, or to add something to the text in the event of you wishing so. The button at the bottom allows you to restart the recognition if you wish to do so.</p>
<h4 id="rvc">Continuous recognition</h4>
<p>When this option is activated, no pop-ups appear on the screen and you can continue speaking while the application is showing you on the screen what you're saying (a bit of time is still needed to analyze the text spoken).</p>
<h4 id="rvaa">Other actions</h4>
<a title="Enlarge" href="../res/images/documentation/menu.png"><img style="width: 30%; float: right;" src="../res/images/documentation/menu.png" alt="PNG" /></a>
<p>The menu at the top of the screen contains more actions. The icon the most on the right allows you to translate the text into French (or English, depending on the language of your device) if you have an active internet connection. This icon also allows you to access the parameters of the application (see below). Then, on the left, you can find options to share. The text can be sent to a third device or to the vocal synthesizer in HandicApp. </p>
<h3 id="p">Settings</h3>
<a title="Enlarge" href="../res/images/documentation/parametres.png"><img style="width: 25%; float: left;" src="../res/images/documentation/parametres.png" alt="PNG" /></a>
<p>Here you can find the different parameters of the application.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size of the text:</strong> allows you to adjust the size of the text you want to synthesize or that of the speech recognition. Three sizes are possible: small, medium and large.</li>
	<li><strong>Speech rate:</strong> allows you to choose the speed at which the vocal synthetizer will speak the given text (slow, medium or fast).</li>
	<li><strong>Speech tone:</strong> allows you to choose the tone of the voice of the vocal synthesizer (low, medium or high).</li>
	<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> allows you to activate or deactivate the continuous speech recognition (see above).</li>
	<li><strong>Help:</strong> gives you access to this documentation about the application.</li>
	<li><strong>HandicApp :</strong> gives you the version number of the application.</li>
