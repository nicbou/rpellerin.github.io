Summary: How I fixed my life 

I have spent the last few months trying to "fix my life". To put it differently, I tried to identify what was wrong and how I could improve my life in general. Although in good shape and healthy, I wanted to be more energetic. Likewise, I had a few bad habits that I wanted to get rid of. Let's go through them:

# Health

- **Quit smoking**: that was definitely the hardest. In total, I'd say it took me several months.
- **Exercice at least 30mins per day**: not always doable. At KAIST, I am fortunate enough to have a gym right next to my dorm.
- **Eat healthy food in moderate quantities (not too much, not too little)**: not easily doable at KAIST. Ultimately, I'd like to become **[a vegetarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KriTQ0aTrtw)**.
- **Stop using electronic devices at least 1 hour before going to sleep**: this is important in order to sleep well. Screens are known to prevent you from falling asleep.
- **Every hour of sitting, stand up for a few minutes**: [more info](http://drcrystaldraper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Health-Hazards-of-Sitting-Washington-Post.jpg).

# Culture

- **Read books (novels) in English**: I am reading "Animal Farm" at the time being.
- **Keep learning English on a regular basis**: the book "The Elements of Style" is on my nightstand.
- **Write in English**: that's what I do with this blog.

# Lifestyle

- Owning as few things as possible. Ideally my whole life would fit in two suitcases.
- [Anti-consumerism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_INOPfPdhB4). It is a mindset I adopted a while ago.

# Other

- **Check Twitter two times a day tops**: that one is pretty hard, I am still struggling.
- **Go to bed before 2am**: same. At some point in the future, being a morning person?

Furthermore, I also started learning about topics that are not related to my skills whatsoever, such as politics, the environment, green energies, etc. I would recommend these videos as a good starting point:

- [Before the Flood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90CkXVF-Q8M): *Join Leonardo DiCaprio as he explores the topic of climate change, and discovers what must be done today to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet.*.
- [Réformons l'élection présidentielle (FR)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoGH7d51bvc)
- [Demain](https://www.demain-lefilm.com/en/film): *Climate is changing. Instead of showing all the worst that can happen, this documentary focuses on the people suggesting solutions and their actions.*.

Moreover, I recently found that [interesting article](http://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/a-23-minute-morning-ritual-that-will-transform-your-whole-day.html) which suggests "*A 23-Minute Morning Ritual That Will Transform Your Whole Day*". I am still working on it... Essentially, it gives 5 things to do in the morning:

1. Write down three acts of gratitude (2 minutes)
2. Journal one positive experience you've had during the past 24 hours (2 minutes)
3. Exercise (15 minutes)
4. Meditation (2 minutes)
5. Express kindness through a text or email (2 minutes)

Last but not least, here are my **New Year's Resolutions for 2017**:

- Read more
- Play another musical instrument
- Learn Dutch and Spanish
- Learn how to dance Rock and Roll.
- Go to a comedy club and jazz bars in New York City and San Francisco
