Summary: Two days spent skiing in the US!

Last weekend, my boss took me to Heavenly Moutain Resort, near Lake Tahoe, at the border between Northern California and Nevada. With his wife and some of their friends, we went there for the weekend. Despite pretty bad road conditions (two major roads closed because of the snow and a mudslide), we eventually made it there, at 6pm on Saturday.

The next day, we had a clear blue sky and great snow on the slopes. Monday was almost as good.

Below is a video of these two days.

This resort is extremely pricey. If my memory serves me, it was $120 per day for ski rental. Plus $135 per day to get a lift ticket. But the view from the top is breathtaking.

One noticeable difference with the French Alps is that ski runs are quite short, at most 15 minutes. At the end of the day, you've spent 1/3 of your time on a chairlift.

All in all, it was a great sojourn! We hit the road again on Monday afternoon, headed back to home.
