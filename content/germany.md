Summary: What I know about Germany

**This is a draft article.**

Recently, I got to spend a few days in D端sseldorf and Cologne. Here is my take on these two cities and Germany.

Generally speaking, Germany is slightly more expensive than France, excepted for food. Supermakets are really affordable. Same goes for restaurants. However, note that tipping is still a thing in Germany, as opposed to France where hardly anybody tips.

Travelling to Germany from France can be done by riding a train, usually Thalys. Quite pricey but very convenient.

One funny fact - and sometimes irritating: not many businesses accept credit/debit cards,they tend to favor cash. Be prepared!

# D端sseldorf

I recommend a little walk in D端sseldorf's old town, Altstadt. Walk by the Rhein, enjoy the fresh air.

A very nice place to chill out and enjoy a nice view at sunset is 25hours Hotel Das Tour. Go to the bar at the top, get yourself a drink, it's very affordable!

Finally, if you're into getting high... check out the Rhine Tower. 9 euros, if my memory serves well.

# Cologne

Unfortunately, I did not get to spend much time there. However, I can still recommend the Cathedral. Most of it is open to the public for free, even a few parts of the crypt.

Going to Cologne from D端sseldorf is cheap, only 11.5 euros by train. I heard one could get even lower prices, depending on the type of train.

That's it for now! Until next time...
