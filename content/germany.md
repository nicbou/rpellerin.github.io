Summary: What I know about Germany

**This is a draft article.**

Recently, I got to spend a few days in Düsseldorf and Cologne. Here is my take on these two cities and Germany.

Generally speaking, Germany is slightly more expensive than France, expected food. Supermakets are really affordable. Also, I think tipping is still a thing in Germany, as opposed to France where hardly anybody tips.
