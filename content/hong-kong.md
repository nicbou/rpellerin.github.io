The above is a video from my trip in Hong-Kong, in 2016. We stayed at [Oi Suen Guesthouse](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294217-d1648655-Reviews-Oi_Suen_Guesthouse-Hong_Kong.html), located at 83 Argyle Street (8th Floor).

# Things to know before going there

- They drive on the left, because it is a British colony.
- Just like most countries in East Asia, they have convenience stores everywhere. Most of them are open 24/7.
- For transportation, buy an Octopus card. It is refundable (a charge will be applied though). You can also use it in many shops as a payment method.
- There is free Wi-Fi at subway stations.
- Most people speak good English.

# Things to do

- Victoria Peak (known as The Peak) offers an incredible view of the city. You can either take a bus or a taxi to get there. The latter option is not so expensive if the cost is split between several people. **Pro tip**: go there right before sunset to enjoy the view during daytime and at night. Do not forget to go to the highest point for a few dollars.
- A market, like Ladies Market.
- Tian Tan Buddha (aka the Big Buddha). Get there by taking the Ngong Ping 360 (an aerial tramway).
- Star Ferry Pier at Tsim Sha Tsui (view over Hong Kong's bay). If you can afford it, go for [a harbour cruise and attend the Symphony of Lights show at 8pm](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/tours-walks/guided-tours/victoria-harbour/SOL-harbour-cruise.jsp) (price: 200 HKD).
