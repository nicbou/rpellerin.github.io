- Doesn't mention names when reporting to their own manager what they've been told
- Doesn't put people under pressure without involving themselves
- Doesn't complain (unless justifiably) and set an example at all times
- Cares about 1 on 1 meetings and avoid postponing them or hijacking them for other purposes
- Helps their team members grow and set ambitious personal goals within the company
