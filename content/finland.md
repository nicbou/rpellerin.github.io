Late March this year, I went to Finland for 3 days over the weekend. As a first-timer, I was not expecting so much snow and ice this late in Winter. We had two sunny days, slightly above 0 degrees celsius. The third day was all snowy.

I got to visit Helsinki and Tampere, the two

R-kioski is to Finland what 7-eleven is to the USA.

Almost every house with more than one floor has its own ladder that reaches the roof. From what I heard it is used to remove snow in Winter.

Public announcements are given in English on the train line that connects Tampere and Helsinki. Also this train is pretty cheap, I paid 18 euros for a one-way ride.

To get to the city center from the airport, ride the I or P train for about half an hour. You'll find the train station undeground, underneath the airport.
