Summary: Recommendations and advice for travelers

This is a draft article about airlines I got to fly with.

# Air France

Kind personel! Usually the crew is very welcoming. Great meals.

# Aeroflot

They guess when you're thirsty (basically any time I would press the "Fly Attendant Call button"). However, their tablets are slow as fuck. And yet they have the latest movies available. Sleeping masks (very comfortable by the way) and kind of slippers provided for free (economy class). Meals were good. WiFi is expensive (5 USD for 15 minutes).

# Peach

Really cheap but very little service.

# Air India

Good personel. Great meals.

# China Airlines

# Ryanair

# easyJet

# Virgin America

# WOW air

# Norwegian
