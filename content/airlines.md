Summary: Recommendations and advice for travelers

This is a draft article about airlines I got to fly with.

# Air France

Kind personel! Usually the crew is very welcoming. Great meals.

# Aeroflot

They guess when you're thirsty (basically any time I would press the "Fly Attendant Call button"). However, their tablets are slow as fuck. And yet they have the latest movies available. Sleeping masks (very comfortable by the way) and kind of slippers provided for free (economy class). Meals were good. WiFi is expensive (5 USD for 15 minutes). Meals were good and of different kinds.

# Peach

Really cheap but very little service. I flew once with them, for barely two hours, maybe three.

# Air India

Good personel. Great meals.

# China Airlines

Great company although I don't remember much about the one time I flew with them.

# easyJet

Small aircrafts, do not expect anything crazy, it is a low cost company. No meals, no Wi-Fi, no tablets.

# Ryanair

Same as easyJet.

# Virgin America

Paid Wi-Fi (can be bypassed using a VPN, though). Drinks are free.

# WOW air

Supposedly a low cost company. They charge everything else though, even my normal sized carry-on bagage. What you get for free is a tiny bag, not bigger than a backpack. No meal included (on a 9 hour flight). No Wi-Fi. No tablets on seats. Even water is paid ($2.99).

# Norwegian

Pretty much the same as WoW air, although they have tablets. As far as I remember, you don't get any food or drinks for free. I was lucky enough to get on their first flight to New York City. Nice lighting in the cabin right after landing.

Oh, and they offer free WiFi.

# Tui Fly

Nice one. On a 9 hour fly from Miami to Paris we got dinner and breakfast, plus sodas for free. Alcoholic drinks were paid. Seats are equipped with tablets and fairly recent movies are available. No free or paid Wi-Fi on board. Quite big aircrafts, mine was a Boeing 787, Dreamliner.
