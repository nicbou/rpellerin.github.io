Summary: I just bought a bike. Here's to a whole new life!

*This is a draft article that I will update as I become a more experienced urban cyclist.*

I recently purchased a second-hand bike from one of my colleagues. By doing so, I intend to commute with it as often as possible and thus reduce metro-induced stress. It's also a good opportunity to save time: exercice while commuting, how great of a combination is that?!

Anyway, the last time I owned a bike was in 2016 when I was living in South Korea. And riding a bike in Paris is a whole lot different from riding one in University campus. Now let's go through the required gear for a pleasant and safe commute:

- A helmet, of course
- A bell, for safety
- Lighting, front and rear
- A U-lock. Any other kind of lock is shit. The best ones on the market are built by [Kryptonite](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/locks-landing/product-details-bicycle.html). I got the [New-U - Evolution Standard (model 2130)](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/content/kryt-us-2/en/products/product-information/current-key/002130.html?type=bicycle) and a [KryptoFlex 410 Double Loop Cable](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/content/kryt-us-2/en/products/product-information/current-key/210818.html?type=bicycle) to lock both wheels.
- A fender/mudguard, for rainy days
- Waterproof pants, for the same reason
- Gloves, they might come in handy in case of fall
- [Anti-pollution mask](https://www.wair.fr/en/)
- Suitable clothes to reduce perspiration

A very important thing to do is to get one's bike engraved as soon as possible. In case of theft, it increases the likelihood of finding it back. In Paris, [BICYCODE](https://www.bicycode.org/) takes care of it.
<br />

That's it for now.
