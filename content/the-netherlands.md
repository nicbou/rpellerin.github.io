Summary: What's so great about the Netherlands
Image: the-netherlands/amsterdam.jpg

Dear Amsterdam, it's been a long time. Too long, actually. I miss you from the bottom of my heart. Blah blah blah.

Joke aside, I lived in Amsterdam for 6 months, from 2015 to 2016. Oh boy did I enjoy the city. I was living the good life doing an interpaid internship but who cares, right?! Since then, I went back to the Netherlands a couple of times. This articles sums up what's so cool about this country and the Dutch people, and why it's a must see for every European out there!

# Amsterdam

The best city of Europe of course! Well, not to everyone but to me at least. Great music venues, great people, shitty weather but awesome canals, boats, and bridges. Gooda, tulips, windmills, all the kind of shit is for tourists. The good stuff, they keep it for themselves: beer, weed and probably the coolest bikes on Earth.

Not everyone is great though. Finding an appartment in Amsterdam was a pain in the ass. I ended up renting the creepiest of all kinds when I first got there, a tiny 10 square meter apartment on the last floor, with a broken sink, no stores and a direct access to the roof with no railings whatsover, even though it was a damn 4-story building. Plus the bathroom was on the landing. GREAT. As you guessed, I did not stay there for long. Shortly after, I found a nice shared house just outside of Amsterdam but easily reachable by metro. Speaking of which, their metro system is really good!

Alright, with no further ado, let's see what places are the best in Amsterdam:

- **Paradiso**: the best nightclub on Earth. Seriously! The place is an actual abandoned church that was turned into a nightclub. Unique experience inside!
- **Melkweg**: another great nightclub.
- **Dam Square**: the central square of Amsterdam
- **Bier Fabriek**
- **[Amsterdam Language Cafe](https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Language-Cafe/?_cookie-check=UBG5G_Y5sCIZoRTT)**: such a great place to meet people, both locals and expats. I met most of my friends there! The guy behind this concept, Koen, is amazing. Go talk to him!
- **Red Light District**
- Ride the **ferry**! It's fun and free and takes you to the upper Amsterdam in no time.
- **Thee Sisters bar**: my favorite bar in the whole city
- **Hannekes Boom**: nice place to chill when the sun is out
- **Amsterdam Roest**: same as above
- **Coco's Outback**
- **Vondelpark**
- **Rembrandtplein**
- **I Amsterdam sign**
- **Foodhallen**
- **Bloemenmarkt**
- Check out one of the numerous **Wok to Walk restaurants**, it's so good!
- Don't forget to go on a **boat ride**. It's definitely worth it! You can also rent one privately, it's not that expensive. I remember using [this service](https://sloepdelen.nl/en/).
- Also, consider **renting a bike** or going on a **free walking tour** (aka "pay a you wish by tip").

That's is basically for Amsterdam. Now, let's see some other cities in Holland.

# The Hague

- Go check the beach out!
- China Town

# Rotterdam

A city which was bombed almost entirely during WW2, then rebuild. Its architecture is rather surprising and ultra modern, thus worth seeing.

# Delft

# Haarlem
