Summary: Random stuff about a project I will probably never carry out

I am writing this here for posterity, again!

Since February 2017, I am doing an internship in San Francisco. It is focused on web technologies. I am learning a shit ton of stuff everyday. Thus I'd like to apply all these best practices and use my daily tools on **ONE BIG PROJECT**.

This killer project must include the following things:

- JavaScript
    - ES7
        - `fetch`
        - Promises
        - `await`/`async`
        - `import`
        - Etc.
    - Web worker
    - Node
    - React (Fiber?) + Redux
        - Webpack: `create-react-app`
        - `reselect`
        - `redux-form`
    - React Native as well?
        - `create-react-native-app`
    - Sequelize: `sequelize` + `sequelize-cli`
    - Express.js + GraphQL (with subscriptions): `express-graphql`
    - Apollo or Relay
    - `dotenv`
    - `jsonwebtoken`?
    - `date-fns`
    - `storybook`?
    - Server-side rendering with Next.js? `create-next-app`
    - `memoizee` for external API calls made by the server
- Progressive Web App
    - Service worker (makes app available offline)
    - [Progressive Web Apps (Cyril Balit - Florian Orpeli√®re)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqi4Xa1ViOQ)
    - Notifications
- CSS
    - Variables
    - Flexbox
    - Grid
    - CSS masks
    - [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
- Testing/CI/Production
    - `jest-cli`
    - `standard-version`
    - Travis-ci.org
    - Now.sh?
- Tools
    - yarn
    - `pm2`
    - Prettier for code formatting
    - [Flow](https://flow.org/): `flow-bin`
    - Chrome extensions
        - React Developer Tools
        - Redux DevTools
        - Apollo Client Developer Tools
        - Lighthouse
    - [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
- Other
    - PostgreSQL or SQLite
    - asm.js or WebAssembly (preferably the latter)
    - [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/)

Bonus point if the project uses as many Github badges (meaning CI services) as I referenced on [this article]({filename}/open-source.md).
