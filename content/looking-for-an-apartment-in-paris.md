Summary: My advice for apartment seekers in Paris

Looking for an apartment in Paris... is a hassle. A lot of demand, too little supply. Not to mention you always - well, almost - need rent guarantors.

# First of all, where to look for apartments?

My three favorite ones:

- [Leboncoin.fr](https://www.leboncoin.fr/locations/offres/ile_de_france/?th=1&ret=2&furn=1)
- [Seloger.com](http://www.seloger.com/list.htm?idtt=1&naturebien=1&idtypebien=1&ci=750110,750109,750111,750118,750119,750105,750120,750117,750112,750113,750114,750106,750104&tri=a_px&surfacemin=15&si_meuble=1)
- [Pap.fr](http://www.pap.fr/annonce/locations-appartement-paris-4e-g37771g37772g37776g37777g37778g37780g37784g37785g37786g37787-a-partir-de-15-m2)

**Pro tip**: enable the alert emails so that you get an email as soon as one ad is posted, or digest emails.

Once you arranged a viewing, you should prepare the documents you are going to have to hand in.

# The documents

In Paris, landlords usually expect people to know what documents are required. However, this might drastically vary from one to another. Here is a list of must and optional ones. If you are extremelly well paid you might not need rent guarantors:

**Must**

- Copies of your ID and your rent guarantors' IDs
- You last three payslips (and those or your guarantors) 
- Last tax notice (*avis d'impôts*)
- Your contract of employment (or student certificate if still a student)

**Optional but often required**

- Guarantors' land tax (*taxe foncière*). [More on this here](https://www.frenchentree.com/french-property/local-property-taxes-taxe-fonciere-and-taxe-dhabitation/)
- Guarantors' residence tax (*taxe d'habitation*). [More on this here](https://www.frenchentree.com/french-property/local-property-taxes-taxe-fonciere-and-taxe-dhabitation/).
- Sworn statement from your guarantors stating they are your guarantors (*attestation sur l'honneur*)

**Rarely required**

- Your guarantors' work contracts or some proof from their employer
- Proof of residency for your guarantors

**However, never hand in your bank details before officially signing the apartment lease.**

Here is the kind of document I hand in alongside all the other documents.

# Keeping track of the apartments you've found and the viewings you've done

I recommend that you create an Excel file to do that. Here is an extract of mine:

- Title of the ad
- URL
- Price per month
- Arrondissement
- Address (if known)
- Floor
- Square meters
- Washing machine or connections?
- Double bed?
- Availability (date)
- Last email sent date (and replies and outcome)
- Last phone call date (and outcome)
- Additional information
- Viewing date

That's it! Hope this helps.
