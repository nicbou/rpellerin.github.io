Summary: My road trip in California, Arizona, Utah and Nevada in 2017

From July 12 to July 27, I was back on the American roads, more precisely the West Coast. This time, my parents and sisters came to visit me. They landed the day my internship ended.
All in all, we drove over 5000 KM (3000+ miles), stayed in rougly 10 AirBnBs, visited 10 national parks and monuments and won about $30 in Vegas!

This article will be updated when I release the movie of our trip.

# Tips for travellers willing to do the same trip

## Zion

If you go to Zion Park and happen to be in good shape and fearless, do the crazy Angels Langing trail! Book a full day for it though.
