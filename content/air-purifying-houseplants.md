Summary: How to purify air using houseplants... or how to pretend you breath purified air.

*This is a draft article.*

Recently, I moved into my new apartment, in one of the most polluted cities on Earth, Paris. Therefore I decided I needed houseplants to clean the air. What an idea! Is it bullshit? Does it actually work? Who cares?! As long as it makes my apartment look cool!

Consequently, I started googling about evergreen houseplants that clean the air. I ended up buying the following plants:

- **[Spathiphyllum](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/spathiphyllum.php)**: the best at improving indoor air quality!
- **[Aglaonema Silver Bay](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/aglaonema.php)**: the plant from the movie *Leon: The Professional*.
- **[Dracaena Marginata](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/dracaena_marginata.php)**
- **Dieffenbachia**
- **[Chlorophytum](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/chlorophytum.php)** (comosum? no sure about its species)

Some time later I'll post here how to take care of these houseplants.

Hope this helps, folks!
