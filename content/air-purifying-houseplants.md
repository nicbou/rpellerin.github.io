Summary: How to purify air using houseplants... or how to pretend you breath purified air.

*This is a draft article.*

Recently, I moved into my new apartment, in one of the most polluted cities on Earth, Paris. Therefore I decided I needed houseplants to clean the air. What an idea! Is it bullshit? Does it actually work? Who cares?! As long as it makes my apartment look cool!

Consequently, I started googling about evergreen houseplants that clean the air. I ended up buying the following plants:

- **[Spathiphyllum](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/spathiphyllum.php)**: the best at improving indoor air quality!
- **[Aglaonema Silver Bay](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/aglaonema.php)**: the plant from the movie *Leon: The Professional*.
- **[Dracaena Marginata](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/dracaena_marginata.php)**
- **Dieffenbachia**
- **[Chlorophytum](http://www.plantes-depolluantes.com/_plantes/chlorophytum.php)** (comosum? no sure about its species)

Some time later I'll post here how to take care of these houseplants.

# Aglaonema

## Temperature

Between 15°C and 25°C. Cannot tolerate below 13.

## Light

300 lux, half shadow, must get sun light a few hours per day (no direct sunlignt though).

## Watering

Soil should be kept moist at all times. Don't allow it to dry otherwise it can cause leaves to drop. In summer, water twice a week. In winter, once. Don't leave standing water in the saucer.

## Repotting

Repotting is from March to May, every 2 to 3 years. For an old Aglaonema, just replace the upper layer of the soil, do not repot.

## Complementary information

Leaves and fruits are toxic for humans and pets.

# Dracaena Marginata

## Temperature

Between 15°C and 22°C. Avoid below 15 (won't grow otherwise). Below 10 could damage it.

## Light

500 lux, quite a log of light. Avoid too much direct sun light. It does not like absence of light.

## Watering

Soil must remain hardly moist. Once or twice a week. Mist the leaves twice a week also, if possible.

## Repotting

Repotting is from March to May, every 2 to 3 years. Every other year, replace the upper layer of the soil, do not repot.

# Spathiphyllum

## Temperature

Between 15°C and 25°C. Below 10 could damage it seriously.

## Light

A significant amount but no direct sun though. Dim light is OK.

## Watering

Once a week, a lot. Don't leave standing water!

## Repotting

In March, every two to three years.

## Complementary information

Avoid dry air as well as fresh air flows.

To foster blossoming, deprive the plant of water for a few days.

Hope this helps, folks!
