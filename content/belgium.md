Summary: What I know about Belgium and my recommendations
Image: belgium.jpg

In late 2015 I went for the first time of my life to Belgium... for a very short time, 24 hours actually. The only city I got to see and walk in was Brussels.

I'll likely update this article in the future when I get the chance to go back to Belgium.

When I went there, it was shortly after the November 2015 Paris attacks. The police was actively looking for terrorists in Brussels, troops were deployed and basically nobody was out there in the streets. The atmosphere was somehow surreal and very strange. I stayed the night in Brussels and left the city the following morning so my experience is very limited. Yet, here is my advice, for what it's worth.

# Brussels

* Go check the Hard Rock cafe out, it's one of the best I've seen in my life. Great stuff inside.
* The Delirium Cafe is a must see, along with the Manneken Pis (the peeing kid statue), which is right by its side.
* The Grand Place is stunning, either at night or during the day. Old buildings surrounding an imposing square.
