*This is a draft article.*

**Friday, January 27, 2017**: I took off from Paris CDG, headed to San Francisco, California. I traveled with WOW Air and had a 2-hour layover in Iceland. We flew over Greenland and Northern Canada. Stunning landscapes!

As I am writing these lines, I already moved in in my new home for the next 6 months: a room in a shared apartment, located between the University of San Francisco and the [Painted Ladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies). We are only two people living in this apartment. The neighborhood is mostly residential. I am close to many grocery stores, very convenient! Moreover, there is an awesome neighborhood located within a walkable distance, called Hayes Valley, which is supposedly the French neighborhood. Indeed, there is a significant number of French businesses (restaurants, a *boulangerie*, etc.). The area is known for its artistic shops.

So, what's the purpose of my trip there? Well, I will be interning at a French company who recently (2013) opened offices in San Francisco to expand their business. This internship is the last step required for me to graduade.

In this article, I will explain and describes my daily life there. Hence, this article will be updated on a regular basis.

#Â Bedding

A hassle. To be continued... Will talk about sizes (King, Queen, Full, etc.), vocabulary, differences with France.

# Grocery shopping

To be written. Will talk about: too many choices. Target, pharmacies (confusing btw), Trader Joe's, taxes, California Refund Value.
