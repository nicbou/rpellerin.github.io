- The retirement age should be increased gradually as life expectancy improves. There should not be an upper limit: anyone must be able to keep working as long as they want. However they should be a minimum age.
- Gay couples should have the **exact same rights** as straight couples, especially regarding marriage and adoption.
- Public institutions and schools should **not** rely on proprietary software like Microsoft Windows. A GNU/Linux-based distribution should be de-facto installed on every computer. Proprietary software could be used as a last resort when special requirements apply (a specific software program for instance). This way, governments would save millions of euros/dollars (licenses are expensive).
- Healthcare should be universal and free.
- We should all aim at reducing pollution. Sales of new diesel cars should be forbidden NOW. Then, within the next five to ten years, [all non-electric car sales should be banne]d. Hybrid cars are just a temporary solution. It misses the long-term goal.
- The working hours of a week should be negotiable on a 40 hour base, for a full-time worker.
