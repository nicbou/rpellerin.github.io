- The retirement age should be increased gradually as life expectancy improves. There should not be an upper limit: anyone must be able to keep working as long as they want. However there should be a minimum age.
- Gay couples should have the **exact same rights** as straight couples, especially regarding marriage and adoption. Preventing them from accessing such basic rights is just as stupid as preventing women from voting. Once the norm, it would nowadays sound ridiculous and outrageous.
- I am in favor of abortion.
- Public institutions and schools should **not** rely on proprietary software like Microsoft Windows. A GNU/Linux-based distribution should be de-facto installed on every computer. Proprietary software could be used as a last resort when special requirements apply (a specific software program for instance). This way, governments would save millions of euros/dollars (licenses are expensive).
- Healthcare should be universal and free. By free, I mean paid for by the government through tax revenue. Not by private companies whatsoever. It's not about how much one values a car, it's about us as human beings.
- We should all aim at reducing pollution. Sales of new diesel cars should be forbidden **NOW**. Then, within the next five to ten years, [All non-electric car sales should be banned](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/netherlands-wants-ban-non-electric-car-sales-by-2025-1576071). [Hybrid cars are just a temporary solution.](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2423424,00.asp) It misses the long-term goal.
- The working hours of a week should be negotiable on a 35 to 40-hour base, for a full-time worker.
- Basic income has to be taken into consideration seriously and experimented for that global population is climbing at a high pace towards [10B people by 2060](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/) and a great number of jobs will soon by replaced by robots. I am not saying that it is the right way to go. Instead, I truly believe this could be a workable solution. Of course taxation would have to be reformed in order to finance it.

- Marijuana (cannabis) consumption should be legal. Both medical and recreational use should be allowed and regulated by heavy taxation. [As seen in the Netherlands](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5730185), [consumption in countries where it is legal tends to be lower than countries where it is not](http://news.berkeley.edu/2011/09/13/lessons-from-dutch-cannabis-system/). Instead of wasting millions in the fight against it (which has proven to be ineffective), a smaller amount of money should be invested in prevention through media campaigns and events.
